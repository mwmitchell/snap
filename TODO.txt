The view handling needs a lot of help
	Find way to register multiple renderers
		
		??
		
		config.renderer[:erb] = lambda {|*options|
			#
		}
		config.renderers[:haml] = lambda {|*options|
			#
		}
		
	Implement way of specifying which renderer to use within app
		
Implement generic PathMatcher and HashMatcher - maybe not?

Filter logic...
	
	before exec
		before exec
			body = exec
		after exec
	after exec

Consider making request, response and config global:
	
	Snap::Web.config
	Snap::Web.request
	Snap::Web.response
	
Then in each of the modules/classes:

	include Snap::Web

classes that use response/request:
	
	context
	event -> filter(blocks) + action
