* nice error handlers for HTTP responses
* change action and zone :path and :full_path to :route and :full_route
* consider removing instance variable in classes (Zone::Event::Base) that render
	- goal: provide ONLY variables set in actions and helper methods?
* more flexibility in template file resolution logic (ability to specify only renderer extension etc.)
* provide shortcut to response.body => :body
* add format type checks to Rack::MimeTypes (already done?)
* remove as much of the core_ext stuff as possible

The view handling needs a lot of help
	Find way to register multiple renderers

		config.renderer[:erb] = lambda {|*options|

		config.renderers[:haml] = lambda {|*options|
			#

	Implement way of specifying which renderer to use within app
		
Implement generic PathMatcher and HashMatcher - maybe not?

Filter logic...
