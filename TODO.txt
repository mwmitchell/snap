Bring in the use method within namespaces to make reusable apps:
	
	namespace 'contact' do
		use MyContactApp
	end

overkill? -- Remove rendering from app scope
	
	copy all instance variables from app, pass into "view" context binding

DONE - Code not-correctly reloading... all namespaces getting added for each request!

DONE (onl for namespaces) - find a way to pass app to all app participants? (action, namespace etc.)

DONE (app now has app.namespaces) - change app.namespace to app.root_namespace

have dispatcher act on proc response objects, or anything with a call method. You could save rendering until after the last :after filter has executed. Could give some interesting possibilities?

NO - Have Snap/config know what app is currently running? Is there ever a possibility that more than one app will be running on the same instance of Snap? In the same process?

Change Action.ns to Action.namespace and raise an exception if a block is used.

DONE - Move configuration stuff out of the Snap module and into a Config module

get request :format from accept type header, not just the url file extension

Register template engines + extensions ? How do you know when a .haml template should be rendered with Haml?
	
	text/html => .erb => Erubis
	text/xml => .xml => Builder
	text/json => .json => Erubis
	text/css => .css => Sass

Scope:
	DONE - actions should be in the app instance scope
	DONE - before filters should have same scope as app instance
	overkill? -> the template binding/scope should be similar to the action scope, except access only to variables, app, request and helper methods.
		copy app variables to view scope
		method_missing in view scope object for dispatching to app methods?
