= Snap - REST made easy

== Overview
Snap is a small web framework for creating RESTful web applications. The heart of Snap is the controller layer; a contextual, block based DSL featuring RESTful action hooks, an event callback system and url param mapping.

The start of any Snap application is a root Zone. Zones are sub-slices of a url and help keep routes DRY. The Zone is responsible for defining the base URL path for it's actions, callbacks and child Zones. One Zone is equal to a (set of?) URL path fragments. For example, a Zone could be /admin/transactions. Within that Zone, there can be multiple actions, callbacks and sub-zones. Once you define a Zone, every child-Zone or callback within it is bound to the path it's defined (DRY's up your "routes").

The request and before/after callbacks are able to negotiate different formats of content using the :format method within an action block.

== Example
Here is a simple example:

 
class AppEvents
	
	include Snap::App

	map do
		
		after do
			nav = <<-EOF
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/">home</a></li>
					<li><a href="/about">about</a></li>
					<li><a href="/about/ruby">about ruby</a></li>
					<li><a href="/markaby">markaby example</a></li>
				</ul>
			EOF
			response.body = "<h1>Snap!</h1><hr/>#{nav}#{response.body}<hr/>"
		end
		
		get {'The root path using GET'}
		
		get :markaby=>'markaby' do
			markaby.div do
				h3 "Render your HTML with Markaby?"
				ul do
					li "markaby is cool"
					li "It's fun to put view logic in your controllers :)"
					li "testing..."
				end
			end
		end
		
		map 'about' do
			get {"Snap is an experimental framework?!"}
			get 'ruby' do
				'Ruby -> http://www.ruby-lang.org'
			end
		end
		
	end
	
end
